Updates since last CLAS12 workshop:
- new solenoid magnet design (symmetric, cryo pipe on top)
- solved mechanical interference with CTOF
- tested shielding for PMTs in magnetic field

Plan for next months:
- build one sector (2 phi bins, 3 radial layers) 
- tests of DAQ configuration and timing performances in cosmic rays for this sector
- finalizing mechanical design for the whole detector
- October 2011: request of funds to IN2P3 to build the whole detector (300 keuros/3 years)

Longer term plan:
- purchase of scintillators, light guides and materials for mechanical structure in 2012
- purchase of PMTs and associated equipment in 2013
- ready for installation in 2014
